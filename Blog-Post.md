# Prague
I lived in the **_Czech_** **_Republic_** for a year.  I tried to learn the language but I failed miserably.   I tried to take lessons and I did eventually get a good foundation.  If you don't use it you loose though.  I probably know a few thinks.

I also visited Prague in the summer of 2018 with a group of 6 friends. It was the time of my _life_. I will **never** forget that few weeks traveling across Europe.
